1. Add ability to manipulate amount of fruits (in code).
2. Add ability to display "Hehehe" when fruit in some specific cell is eaten.
3. Add ability to add another cell type and check collision between borders.
4. Add ability to pause/unpause the game.

That will conclude the ultimate test for my code scalability.
