1. Add ability to manipulate amount of fruits (in code).
2. Add ability to display "Hehehe" when fruit in some specific cell is eaten.
3. Add ability to add another cell type and check collision between borders.
4. Add ability to pause/unpause the game.
5. class PainterContext:
    def __init__(self, painter):
        self.painter = painter

    def __enter__(self):
        # Save the original state of the painter at the beginning of the block
        self.painter.save()

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Restore the painter to its original state at the end of the block
        self.painter.restore()

That will conclude the ultimate test for my code scalability (and retardability).
