Field ideas here whatever:

1. Simple snake game, 1 fruit.
   Get 20 score.
2. Snake game where snake can go through the walls.
   Get 20 score.
3. Snake game with kinky fruit that has 95% change of teleporting away when the snake gets close.
   Get 1 score.
4. Snake game with new custom cell type - blocks.
   Get 20 score.
5. Mini - Labyrinth (2x2 minimum)
   Get 20 score.
6. AI snake. The battle xD
   Get 20 score first.
7. New cell type - portals
   Get 20 score.
8. Moving horizontal thing (left, right, left, right idk)
   Get 20 score.
9. Labyrinth 1x1
   Get the FRUIT and not die (1 score).
10. Cursed (your head gets tpd randomly on the field every 10th turn)
    Get 20 score.

Main idea how to do that:

1. Make a class that would load the field into the SnakeField class
2. Make a Snake Game Widget Builder, so it would be easy to attach whatever 'Snake' classes to it.
3. Make a game win condition function in 'SnakeCore'?

Ideas for each individual game idea:

1. Easy.
2. Meeh, override collision detection function and thats all.
3. Xddd, override the game turn function, and move the fruit in it. Maybe override fruit spawn function as well.
4. Just override make turn and collision functions.
5. Just fun mapping you know.
6. The hardest yet, skip for now.
7. Just, collision and make turn override, that is all.
8. Additionally override __init__ and create the thing and every turn, move it to the left or to the right.
9. Xddddm literall 19984 frfr.
10. Ummmhm, override the make turn i guess.
